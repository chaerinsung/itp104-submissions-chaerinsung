			<h2>About</h2>

				<img src="about.jpg" alt="main characters">
				<p>
					<em>Everything Everywhere All at Once</em> is a 2022 American absurdist comedy-drama film written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (collectively known as "Daniels"), who produced it with the Russo brothers. It stars Michelle Yeoh as a Chinese American woman being audited by the IRS who discovers that she must connect with parallel universe versions of herself to prevent a powerful being from causing the destruction of the multiverse. Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, Jenny Slate, Harry Shum Jr., James Hong, and Jamie Lee Curtis appear in supporting roles. The film was described by <em>The New York Times</em> as a "swirl of genre anarchy" and features elements of black comedy, science fiction, fantasy, martial arts film, and animation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kwan and Scheinert researched the concept of the multiverse as far back as 2010, and began penning the screenplay as early as 2016. Originally written for Jackie Chan, the lead role was later reworked and offered to Yeoh. Principal photography began in January 2020 and concluded in March as the COVID-19 pandemic reached the United States. The film's soundtrack features music composed by Son Lux, including collaborations with musicians Mitski, David Byrne, André 3000, and Randy Newman.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Everything Everywhere All at Once</em> premiered at South by Southwest on March 11, 2022, and began a limited theatrical release in the United States on March 25, before a wide release by A24 on April 8. The film received widespread critical acclaim. Reviews praised its imagination, direction, and screenplay; Yeoh's performance; and its handling of themes such as existentialism, nihilism, and Asian American identity. It has grossed over $100 million worldwide, becoming A24’s first movie to do so and surpassing <em>Hereditary</em> (2018) as its highest-grossing film.

			<h2>Plot</h2>
			<hr>
				<h3>Part 1: Everything</h3>
					<img src="part1.png" alt="joy's first encounter with the multiverse">
					<p>
						Evelyn Quan Wang is a Chinese American immigrant who runs a struggling laundromat with her husband, Waymond. Tensions are high: the laundromat is being audited by the IRS, Waymond is trying to serve Evelyn divorce papers, Evelyn's demanding father, Gong Gong, has just arrived from Hong Kong, and Evelyn's daughter, Joy, has been trying to get her mother to accept her girlfriend, Becky.
					</p>
					<p>
						At a meeting with IRS inspector Deirdre Beaubeirdre, Waymond's personality changes when his body is briefly taken over by Alpha Waymond, a version of Waymond from a universe he calls the "Alphaverse". Alpha Waymond explains to Evelyn that many parallel universes exist, since every choice made creates a new universe. The people of the Alphaverse, led by the late Alpha Evelyn, developed "verse-jumping" technology that allows people to access the skills, memories, and body of their parallel universe counterparts by fulfilling specific conditions. The multiverse is being threatened by Jobu Tupaki, the Alphaverse version of Joy. Her mind was splintered after Alpha Evelyn pushed her to extensively verse-jump; Jobu Tupaki now experiences all universes at once and can verse-jump and manipulate matter at will. With her godlike power she has created a black hole-like "everything bagel" that can potentially destroy the multiverse.
					</p>
					<p>
						Evelyn is given verse-jumping technology to fight Jobu Tupaki's verse-jumping minions, who begin converging in the IRS building. Evelyn learns of Waymond's plans to divorce her and discovers other lives where she made different choices and flourished, such as by becoming a kung fu master and movie star instead of leaving China with Waymond, who becomes a successful businessman. Alpha Waymond comes to believe that Evelyn, as the greatest failure of all Evelyns of the multiverse, has the untapped potential to defeat Jobu Tupaki. Alpha Gong Gong instructs Evelyn to kill Joy to hinder Jobu Tupaki, but Evelyn refuses. She decides she must face Jobu Tupaki by gaining the same powers as her, so she verse-jumps repeatedly while battling Jobu Tupaki's minions and Alpha Gong Gong's soldiers. After the battle, Alpha Waymond is located and killed by Jobu Tupaki in the Alphaverse and Evelyn's mind splinters.
					</p>

				<h3>Part 2: Everywhere</h3>
					<img class="floatleft" src="part2.png" alt="the bagel">
					<p>
						Evelyn verse-jumps to other, bizarre universes, including one in which humans have hot dogs for fingers and she is in a romantic relationship with Deirdre, and another where she works alongside a <em>teppanyaki</em> chef who is secretly puppeteered by a raccoon. She learns that Jobu Tupaki created the everything bagel not to destroy everything, but to destroy herself, and has been searching for an Evelyn who can understand her. Jobu Tupaki feels that because there are so many vast universes and unending chaos, nothing truly matters and she wishes to simply no longer exist.
					</p>
					<p>
						In other universes, the Wangs are about to lose the laundromat due to tax errors, hot dog Evelyn's relationship with Deirdre falls apart, and businessman Waymond rejects movie star Evelyn after decades apart. Evelyn is nearly swayed to Jobu Tupaki's cause after a long philosophical discussion throughout several universes, and stabs her universe's Waymond. She almost joins Jobu Tupaki in entering the bagel, but stops when she hears Waymond's pleas for both Evelyn and Alpha Gong Gong's fighters to stop fighting, be kind, and have hope, even in a universe where nothing seems to make sense. Evelyn defeats Alpha Gong Gong and Jobu Tupaki's fighters by using her multiverse knowledge to find what is hurting each of them and brings them happiness. Evelyn reaches Jobu Tupaki and tells her that she is not alone and that Evelyn will always choose to be with her, despite everywhere else she could be. Meanwhile, in a parallel universe, Evelyn confronts Gong Gong and reconciles with Waymond and Joy, and Waymond convinces Deirdre to let the Wangs redo their taxes. Jobu Tupaki initially rejects Evelyn, but returns to her, and they embrace.
					</p>

				<h3>Part 3: All at Once</h3>
					<p>
						Shortly thereafter, the family's relationships and lives have improved; Becky is now regarded as a part of the family, Waymond and Evelyn share a brief but romantic moment for the first time in a long while, and they return to the IRS building on a second chance to file their taxes. As Deirdre talks, Evelyn's attention is momentarily drawn to her alternate selves and the multiverse, before she grounds herself back in her home universe.
